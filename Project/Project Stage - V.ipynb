    "The final presentation is on Nov 26 (Presentation order 1-5) and Dec 3(Presentation order 6-10). Each group will have exactly 15 minutes slot to showcase your whole project process (make a summary of each stage) and share the results/reports achieved as a team, as well as selected individual work. Within your team, you can either nominate a single presenter or allow team members to take turns presenting. Please note that it's crucial for all team members to be present during the presentation. The instructor might pose questions that require input from any team member, so your collective presence is valuable. Look forward to your insightful presentations!"
