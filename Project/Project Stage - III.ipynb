Within the state you can compare the county based covid data to enrichment data for correlation. Between states you would need to aggregate to state level data and then perform correlation. Both covid and enrichment data will need to be normalized for population. For number of covid cases you can use a measure of center value (median or mean) to compare the number of cases. \n",
